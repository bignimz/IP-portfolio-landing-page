# Personal Portfolio Project

Personal Portfolio is a website that is developed to talk about myself, my ambitions, skills set as well as showcase my web development skills in a well presentable manner. This design template can be used by any person in the tech industry but mostly software developers to showcase their skills to potential employers. The design is Desktop view only and not yet optimized for viewing on mobile devices. The Portfolio web page is designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for added functionality.
